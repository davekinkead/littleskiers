          <p>Skiing is fun, it’s wonderful times outdoor, it’s amazing to get to the top of the mountain even just to enjoy the views!
Getting up there however is not cheap, lift passes in Austria waries from 30-49 euro for a 1 day pass but luckily gets cheaper the more days you buy.</p>
<p>Our family opted to do the full 3-4 month ski seasons to get the best value on a season pass, in most Austrian resorts you get a refund at the end of the winter if you work for a local company all winter, that is great.</p>
<p>However if you don’t work locally, we learned - the hard way, that by having just a few days patience and signing in at the local city council to make your new winter home your primary place of residence, then you get a locals discount of about 30%, this was at least the deal in Zillertal, not sure about other resorts. </p>
<p>Well the first winter there, we excitedly purchased the Zillertal Super ski pass on the weekend, before registering at the local city council the following Monday, unfortunately we missed out on the discount, as we only got toknow about it upon registering. 
Second season we waited till we have proof of being “locals” to purchase our Zillertal Super ski passes - much better!</p>
<p>We had considered to get the Snow card Tirol season passes which cover 91 resorts, but we didn’t as we would not have a car for the winter. However had we known in advance that children automatically get the Snow card Tirol as season pass we would most likely had paid the extra 50 Euro for each adult, just for having the opportunity to ski some of the 91 resorts it covers.</p>
<p>So how do you do it? </p>
<p>Firstly, you have to secure your permanent acommodation for the winter, there is pleanty of fully furnished holiday apartments, and some landlords do prefer to rent out long term instead of having new guests weekly, so give it a shot and email as many holiday apartment places as you can find in your preferred ski area.</p>
<p>Secondly, to secure your acommodation for the winter, often you will have to pay for 4 months minimum, so be prepared for a contract of this lenght of time, arrange a written contract if you are most comfortable with this or just do a verbal/email agreement, the times we have rented we have paid for the last month of the season rental as the initial holding deposit. </p>
<p>Third, when you register as a local resident you do not have to pay the normal Austrian visitor kurtax. The kurtax is approximately 1,80 Euro per adult per day. Instead you need to get a <a href="https://www.help.gv.at/Portal.Node/hlpd/public/resources/documents/meldez.pdf">Meldezettel</a> the registering from the local Gemeinde (which is the local council office).Once you fill in the Meldezettel and ask your landlord to sign it, you can bring it back to the Gemeinde along with your passport to register that this address will be you main place of residence from now on.</p>
<p>Fourth, go buy your season pass and go enjoy the slopes!!</p>
<p>Please note that there are rules for stays in Austria over 3 months. Non-EU citizen can stay 3 months or as per their visa, EU residents can stay up to 4 month without further registration.</p>
