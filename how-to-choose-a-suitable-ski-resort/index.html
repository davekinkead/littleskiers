          <p>It can be pretty hard to choose the best ski resort that is perfect for the entire family. Most often each member will have different level of skill, everyone wants to have fun and but it is certainly possible to find a suitable resort with a bit of research. </p>
<p>Parents with beginner kids can either choose to use ski school or teach the kids them selves. Regardless the family will most likely be skiing together for a bit of the time, and for that pistes and lifts that is well suited to the kids is important for a great experience together.</p>
<p>So look at the information available online for a few resorts of your interest</p>
<ul>
<li>does it have a ski school?</li>
<li>will there be ski teachers able you speak your kid&#39;s language?</li>
<li>are your kids old enough to understand a second language?</li>
<li>once you have decided on ski school options, then look at the pistes available for the adults in the resort.</li>
<li>what is the selection of blue, reds and black according to the adults experience?</li>
<li>how many chair lifts, gondolas is there compared to T-bars and plate lifts</li>
</ul>
<p>If the parents choose to teach the kids themselves the priorities has to be more child focussed when it comes to choice of the resort.
We are currently doing our third full ski season in Austria, our kids where 2 &amp; 5 the first winter, and we have learned that it is quite important to consider slightly other factors if you are going to teach the kids yourself.
Unfortunately it&#39;s pretty hard to work out these details untill you are in it, but some pistemap and lift research can help. 
When skiing with beginner kids, especially little kids the level stepeness of the blue piste can easily affect how well the skiing works out, if they are too scared they won&#39;t learn.
Having access to a magic carpet makes the first few ski days much easier than having to use a T-bar or plate lift.
Then for the next step up from the magic carpet, a chair lift to the easy blue pistes is highly recommended over having to use the T-bar and plate lifts. In most resorts your only option is the T-bar and plate lift, and of course the kids can manage just fine, but they will certainly get tired and bored of it sooner than having a chairlift to chill out on between the runs.</p>
