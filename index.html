    <p> From what age can kids learn to ski?
 Children can start on skis from about 2 years old, at this age it simply starts with learning to balance on absolutely flat snow on a pair of skis, at this age it is a very slow process, so be prepared with patience! 
 The 2-3 year old child will get bored or exhausted with the activity quite quickly so it best to start out slow, if the child gets enough, it’s better to stop for the day or have a break as it’s meant to be fun not a chore. It’s never pleasant to see crying children not having fun, as it’s meant to be fun!</p>... <a class="read-more" href="/from-what-age-can-kids-learn-to-ski" title="Read more...">»</a>

    <p> From what age can kids learn to ski?
 For the keen parents, I can say that our youngest started skiing at 2,5 years, at this age it simply starts with learning to balance and glide on the flat snow, also skiing between the parents legs for a lot of the time. The learningprocess at this age is very slow, so be patient! The child will not always understand how to do the snowplov or what to use it for, and the childs mucles is often not that strong that they can master the snowplov. 
 The 2-3 year old child will get bored or exhausted with the activity quite quickly so it best to start out with short days. If you only have a week, and want to make the most of it, it’s better to stop for a long lunch/play/nap or have lots of little breaks. 
 You can also consider to bring a pram for lunch naps! We brought our pram to the top of the mountain the entire winter our youngest was 2,5 and learning to ski, as it&#39;s hard work for the child too. He did fall asleep while standing with me on the T-bar twice when I stretched the skiing time a bit far past lunch. It&#39;s not an easy task to hold a sleepimg child while getting off the T-bar let alone riding it.
 It was not problem to get the pram in a 6-8 seater gondola, and the advantage was that we could stack the kids skis + boots in the storage basket under the pram. That way the rest of the family can ski the full day, just one adult has to stay by the pram sipping a drink in the sun, maybe even bring a book or enjoy the view. Remember skiing is meant to be fun for everyone! </p>... <a class="read-more" href="/from-what-age-can-kids-learn-to-ski" title="Read more...">»</a>
